# exp_yubikey_signing
An experimental repository set up in a way that a Yubikey can be used to sign commits

When I commit this change, it should be signed with my YubiKey nano and that signature should be visible in the commit history.

Well, it wasn't, so I need to figure out why.

Hmm, seems I used the wrong key. Let's try again.
